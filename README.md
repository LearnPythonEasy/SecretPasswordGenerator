These passwords all include:
- an adjective

- a symbol

> All these factors can help you get a very secure password!

> 1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system to verify this, please open CMD (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), and do
```
python --version
```
> 2. If it says something like `Python 2.7.10`, then you're all good. Feel free to skip step 3.

> 3. You need to install Python! Visit [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the correct version for your system. Then, you should be good to go!

> 4. Now that Python is good to go, please download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/LearnPythonEasy/SecretPasswordGenerator/releases) and save it to somewhere easy to get to with CMD or Terminal (like Desktop or Documents).

```
cd [location]
```
> Replace `[location]` with wherever you saved it (Desktop, Documents, etc). For example,
